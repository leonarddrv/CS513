This website is for maintaining a portfolio for CS 578 project which is done by **Hasan BalcÄ±** and **Leonard Dervishi**.

This project aims a deep analysis of the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database that consists of three massive offshore leaks (2013-Offshore Leaks, 2016-Panama Papers and 2016-Bahama Leaks) to infer relationships among people, companies and countries. 
For this purpose, we will apply known clustering and graph algorithms together with the specified queries on the Neo4j graph database where the data is represented. 
We may need to implement extensions of these algorithms to Neo4j graph database in order to apply them for the detailed analysis.
