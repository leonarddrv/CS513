Graph databases are a type of NoSQL database that use a graph data model and can be used in a variety of natural language processing techniques.
 
This video provides an overview of graph databases, followed by a survey of the role for graph databases in natural language processing tasks, including:
* modeling text as a graph
* mining word associations from a text corpus using a graph data model and
* mining opinions from a corpus of product reviews.

It concludes with a demonstration of how graphs can enable content recommendation based on keyword extraction.

This video is important for us to learn **how a text can be represented as a graph** and **how NLP-related operations can be done** on that graph.
