[This magazine article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/metabrown/2016/04/30/why-panama-papers-journalists-use-graph-databases/) from Forbes explains briefly why ICIJ used graph databases to organize the huge Panama Papers leakage data.
It mentions that relational databases are not appropriate for the management of the lengthy documents or for the complex relationships that connect them.
Whereas, article states that graph databases are more appropriate structures for applications that need to find related documents quickly, especially when one need only a few documents at a time. 
Therefore, using graph databases facilitate the representation and analysis on Panama Papers data, especially for journalists from all over the world.
Even though it is not related with the implementation of our project, this is **an informative article** to understand in what kind of data the usage of graph databases are useful.
