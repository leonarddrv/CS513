title: "ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database"
category: Database
---

[This database](https://offshoreleaks.icij.org) contains information on almost 500,000 offshore entities that are part of the Panama Papers, the Offshore Leaks and the Bahamas Leaks investigations. The data covers nearly 40 years – from 1977 through to early 2016 – and links to people and companies in more than 200 countries and territories.

We will analyze this database during the semester as the course project. 
The data is represented as Neo4j graph database, which makes it easier to analyze.
We will apply some known clustering and graph algorithms on this graph database to infer some (may be not seen so far) relationships between people, companies and countries.
Since Neo4j does not have some of these algorithms, we are planning to implement extensions of these algorithms to Neo4j when needed.
