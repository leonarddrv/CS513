[This article](https://graphaware.com/neo4j/2016/07/07/mining-and-searching-text-with-graph-databases.html) talks about how
(NLP) techniques are used for handling huge amount of data and converting it into useful sources of 
information for further processing.

Information Extraction is defined as the process of analysing text, and checking the relationships between semantic entities.
Relationships can be stored in database and they can be accesed through 'cipher' queries. In the article it is also included 
the concept of GraphAware NLP, which is a relatively new tool for managing textual data.
