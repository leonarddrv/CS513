[This paper](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~anton.dries/files/mlg2010.pdf) proposes several extensions to a previously proposed data model and query language (BiQL). 
The main elements of these extensions are aggregates, rankings and path expressions that allow to calculate well-known network statistics (such as centrality measures), transform networks for the application of more advanced mining algorithms or more complex probabilistic measures (such as connection probabilities).

This paper is **important** to give an idea about *how we can enhance our queries* to explore the ICIJ Offshore Database in more detail. 
The extensions proposed by the paper that are in BiQL language can be transfered to the Neo4j's query language Cypher and then can be used to make more complex queries.
