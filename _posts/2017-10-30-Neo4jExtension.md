title: "Extending Neo4j with Extensions"
category: Website

[This website](https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/#server-extending) shows how the capabilities of the Cypher (Neo4j's query language) can be extended by writing extensions.
Since we aim to write an extension for querying additional graph and clustering algorithms in Neo4j, this is **a beneficial guideline** for our purpose. 

This guideline shows:

* how to write a procedure
* how to write integration tests for procedures
* how to write an unmanaged extension
* how to use Cypher in the extension
* how to test an extension

The extensions are written in Java language. We aim to **study this guideline** and **start to write our own extension** soon.
